Currently I work at Intel OTC on the graphics team,
mostly creating havoc in the kernel driver part of our stack and tightly related
parts.

I'm also the kernel maintainer for the drm/i915 driver, the official git repo I
maintain is at:
[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm-intel](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm-intel)

All the low-level tooling and especially all the kernel driver testcases can be
found at:
[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/)

Most of my own code and development about all things graphic can be found at:
[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~danvet](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Edanvet)

I occasionally post nonsense on twitter as [@danvet](https://twitter.com/danvet)
but the more reliable way to contact me is to send a mail to: daniel PUNGGT
vetter Ã„T ffwll PUNGGT ch. Or ping me on IRC, I'm `danvet` on FreeNode and
generally hang around on `#dri-devel` and `#intel-gfx`.
