Currently I work at Intel OTC on the graphics team,
mostly creating havoc in the kernel driver part of our stack and tightly related
parts.

I have been drm/i915 kernel maintainer for a few years, but handed that all off
to a great new team. Still, the official git repo I maintain is at:
[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm-intel](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm-intel)

All the low-level tooling and especially all the kernel driver testcases can be
found at:
[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/)

Most of my own code and development about all things graphic can be found at:
[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~danvet](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/%7Edanvet)

I occasionally post nonsense on twitter as [@danvet](https://twitter.com/danvet)
but the more reliable way to contact me is to send a mail to: daniel PUNGGT
vetter Ã„T ffwll PUNGGT ch. Or ping me on IRC, I'm `danvet` on FreeNode and
generally hang around on `#dri-devel` and `#intel-gfx`.
