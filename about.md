Currently I work at Intel's Linux Cloud SE group, mostly creating havoc in
kernel driver's given my more than a decade of work in the graphics subsystem.
I'm also co-maintaining the graphics subsystem. I also have been drm/i915 kernel
maintainer for a few years, but handed that all off to a great new team.

Most of my own code and development about all things graphic can be found on
[gitlab.fd.o](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/danvet).

I occasionally post nonsense on mastodon as <a rel="me"
href="https://chaos.social/@sima">@sima</a>, but the more reliable way to
contact me is to send a mail to: daniel PUNGGT vetter Ã„T ffwll PUNGGT ch. Or
ping me on IRC, I'm `danvet` on [OFTC](https://oftc.net/) and generally hang
around on `#dri-devel` and `#intel-gfx`.
