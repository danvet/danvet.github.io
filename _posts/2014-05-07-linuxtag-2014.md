Tomorrow I'll be travelling to LinuxTag in Berlin for the first time. Should be
pretty cool, and to top it off I'll give a presentation about the
[state of the intel kernel graphics
driver](http://www.linuxtag.org/2014/de/programm/vortragsdetails/?eventid=2332). For those that can't attend I've
uploaded the [slides](/slides/linuxtag-2014.odp)
already, and if there's a video cut I'll link to that as soon as it's available.
