title: New Blog Engine!
---

I finally unlazied and moved my blog away from the Google mothership to
something simply, fast and statically generated. It's built on
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on
[github](https://github.com/danvet/danvet.github.io). It's not quite as fancy as
the old one, but with some googling I figured out how to add pages for tags and
an archive section, and that's about all that's really needed.

Comments are gone too, because I couldn't be bothered, and because everything
seems to add Orwellian amounts of trackers. Ping [me on IRC, by mail](/about) or
[on twitter](https://twitter.com/danvet) instead. The share buttons are also
just plain links now without tracking for Twitter (because I'm there) and G+
(because all the cool kernel hackers are there, but I'm not cool enough).

And in case you wonder why I blatter for so long about this change: I need a new
blog entry to double check that the generated feeds are still at the right spots
for the various planets to pick them up ...
