Seems that there was a rift in the spacetime that sucked away the [video of my
LCA talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ9Y0midtW4&feature=youtu.be), but
the awesome [NextDayVideo team](https://twitter.com/nextdayvideo) managed to
pull it back out. And there's still the
[writeup](/2017/01/maintainers-dont-scale.html) and
[slides](/slides/lca-2017.pdf) available.
