I've done a talk at [XDC 2015](http://www.x.org/wiki/Events/XDC2015/)
about atomic modesetting with a focus for driver writers. Most of the talk is an
overview of how an atomic modeset looks and how to implement the different parts
in a driver backend. Anyway, for all those who missed it, there's a
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl9suFgbTc8) and [slides](/slides/xdc-2015.pdf).
