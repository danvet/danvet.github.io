It is election season again for the X.org Foundation. Beside election half of
the board seat we again have some paperwork changes - after updating the bylaws
last year we realized that the membership agreement hasn't been changed since
over 10 years. It talks about the previous-previous legal foundation, has old
addresses and a bunch of other things that just don't fit anymore. In the board
we've updated it to reflect our latest bylaws (thanks a lot to Rob Clark doing
the editing), with no material changes intended.

Like bylaw changes any change to the membership agreement needs a qualified
supermajority of all members, every vote counts and not voting essentially means
voting no.

To vote, go to [https://members.x.org](https://members.x.org), log in and hit
the "Cast" button on the listed ballot.

Voting closes by&nbsp; <strong>23:59 UTC on 11 April 2017</strong>, but
please don't cut it short, it's a computer that decides when it's over ...
