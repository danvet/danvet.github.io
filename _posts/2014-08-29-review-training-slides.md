We currently have a large influx of new people contributing to i915 - for the
curious just check the git logs. As part of ramping them up I've done a few
trainings about upstream review, and a bunch of people I've talked with at KS in
Chicago were interested in that, too. So I've cleaned up the slides a bit and
dropped the very few references to Intel internal resources. No speaker notes or
video recording, but I think this is useful all in itself. And of course if you
have comments or see big gaps - feedback is very much welcome:
