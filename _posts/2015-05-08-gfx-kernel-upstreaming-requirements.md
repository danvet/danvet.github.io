Upstreaming requirements for the DRM subsystem are a bit special since Dave Airlie requires a full-blown open-source implementation as a demonstration vehicle for any new interfaces added. I've figured it's better to clear this up once instead of dealing with the fallout from surprises and made a few slides for a training session. Dave reviewed and acked them, hence this should be the up-to-date rules - the old mails and <a href="https://airlied.livejournal.com/73337.html">blogs</a> <a href="https://airlied.livejournal.com/73337.html">back</a> <a href="https://airlied.livejournal.com/76383.html">from</a> when some ARM SoC vendors tried to push drm drivers for blob userspace to upstream are a bit outdated.<br /><br />Any here's the <a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/~danvet/presentations/gfx_kmd_upstream_abi_requirements.pdf">slides for my gfx kernel upstreaming requirements training</a>.
