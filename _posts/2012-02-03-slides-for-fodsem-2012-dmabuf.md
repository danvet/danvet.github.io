I'm to lazy to publish a proper writeup of my FOSDEM talk of where dma_buf is
currently standing, where it'll likely head to and what to might still come in
1-2 years. But you can grabt the <a
href="/slides/fosdem2012-dma_buf.odp">slides</a>.
Enjoy!

Edit: Phoronix also has an article with <a
href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTA1NDE">video</a>
recordings.
