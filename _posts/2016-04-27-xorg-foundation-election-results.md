Two questions were up for voting, 4 seats on the Board of Directors and approval of the amended By-Laws to join SPI.



Congratulations to our reelected and new board members Egbert Eich, Alex Deucher, Keith Packard and Bryce Harrington. Thanks a lot to Lucas Stach for running. And also big thanks to our outgoing board member Matt Dew, who stepped down for personal reasons.



On the bylaw changes and merging with SPI, 61 out of 65 active members voted, with 54 voting yes, 4 no and 3 abstained. Which means we're well past the 2/3rd quorum for bylaw changes, and everything's green now to proceed with the plan to join SPI!
