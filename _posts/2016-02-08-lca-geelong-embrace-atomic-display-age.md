Back from another awesome linux.conf.au, still the best general Linux conference
even the second time around. I've also done a talk about all the [shiny new
atomic display
support](https://linux.conf.au/schedule/30132/view_talk?day=wednesday) in the kernel, and the great LCA AV team has
[uploaded the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjiB_JeDn2M&amp;feature=youtu.be)
already, and [the slides are here](/slides/lca-2016.pdf).
