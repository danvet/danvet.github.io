So I'm stuck somewhere on an airport and jetlagged on my return trip from my
very first LCA in Auckland - awesome conference, except for being on the wrong
side of the globe: Very broad range of speakers, awesome people all around,
great organization and since it's still a community conference none of the
marketing nonsense and sales-pitch keynotes.

Also done a presentation about
[botching up ioctls](/2013/11/botching-up-ioctls.html).
Compared to my blog post a bunch more details on technical issues
and some overall comments on what's really important to avoid a v2 ioctl because
v1 ended up being unsalvageable.

team).
