EOSS in Prague was great, lots of hallway track, good talks, good food,
[excellent tea at meetea](https://www.meetea.cz/) - first time I had proper tea
in my life, quite an experience. And also my first talk since covid, pack room
with standing audience, [apparently one of the top ten most attended talks per
LF's conference
report](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EOSS-23-PostEventReport_072023.pdf).

The [video recording is now
uploaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPH3MUw9m0o), I've uploaded [the fixed
slides](/slides/elce-2023-locking.pdf), including the missing slide that I
accidentally cut in a last-minute edit. It's the same content as my blog posts
from last year, first talking about [locking engineering
principles](/2022/07/locking-engineering.html) and then [the hierarchy of
locking engineering patterns](/2022/08/locking-hierarchy.html).
