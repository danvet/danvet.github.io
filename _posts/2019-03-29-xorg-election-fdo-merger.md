Aside from the regular [board
elections](https://www.x.org/wiki/BoardOfDirectors/Elections/2019/) we also have
some [bylaw
changes](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorgfoundation/bylaws/blob/bylaw-updates/bylaws.pdf)
to vote on. As usual with bylaw changes, we need a supermajority of all members
to agree - if you don't vote you essentially reject it, but the board has no way
of knowing.

Please see the [detailed changes of the
bylaws](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorgfoundation/bylaws/commit/06e7f04f79131df2c86e9cdfedc00aa1d1ec3f52),
make up your mind, and go voting on the [shiny new members
page](https://members.x.org/).
