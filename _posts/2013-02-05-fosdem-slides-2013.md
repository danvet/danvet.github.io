FOSDEM was great as ever, despite that I've managed to grab a bit too much
attention from my management by spilling the Intel OTC gfx driver team headcount
a bit ;-) Anyway, for those who missed my presentation, I've uploaded [the
slides](/slides/fosdem-2013.odp)
(with that embarrassing typo fixed in one headline). Phoronix should upload a
video of the talk soon, I'll add a link as soon as that happens.
