So as usual FOSDEM was a blast and as usual the hallway track was great too. The beer certainly helped with that ... Big props to the entire conference crew for organizing a stellar event and specifically to Luc and the other graphics devroom people.



I've also uploaded the slides for my [Kernel GPU Driver Testing](/slides/fosdem-2014.odp) talk. My OCD made me remove that additional dot and resurrect the missing 'e' in one of the slides even. FOSDEM also had live-streaming and rendering videos should eventually show up, I'll add the link as soon as it's there.



<b>Update:</b> FOSDEM staff published the [video of the talk](http://video.fosdem.org/2014/H1301_Cornil/Sunday/Testing_Kernel_GFX_Drivers.webm)!
