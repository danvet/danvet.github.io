    In some project there's an awesome process to handle newcomer's contributions - autobuilder picks up your pull and runs full CI on it, coding style checkers automatically do basic review, and the functional review load is also at least all assigned with tooling too.<br /><br />Then there's projects where utter chaos and ad-hoc process reign, like the Linux kernel or the X.org community, and it's much harder for new folks to get their foot into the door. Of course there's documentation trying to bridge that gap, tools like get_maintainers.pl to figure out whom to ping, but that's kinda the details. In the end you need someone from the inside to care about what you're doing and guide you through the maze the first few times.<br /><br />I've been pinged about this a few times recently on IRC, so I figured I'll type up my recommended best practices.<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a>The crucial bit is that such unstructured developer communities run entirely on mutual trust, and patches get reviewed through a market of favours as in "I review yours and you review my patches". As a newcomer you have neither. The goal is to build up enough trust and review favours owed to you to get your patches in.<br /><ul><li>Write a few small, simple patches in related areas. When developing your patches you probably had to read some code, documentation, look at testcases, and very likely you spotted a small thing or two that could be improved. Create a patch for each of those and submit them - it's a great way to test-drive the process and make first contact. Some projects even have tools to hunt for trivial things, e.g. Linux' checkpatch.pl. And as a maintainer I try hard to give everyone a chance to land their first few simple patches fast and try to review&amp;merge them within days.</li><li>Talk about what you're doing on IRC or whatever your project uses for fast&amp;informal communication. Interactive communication is much faster at clearing up initial misunderstandings compared to mailing lists and similar things like pull request discussions. It's also more scary, but let's be honest: If the community you want to contribute too isn't open&amp;friendly, you probably don't want to stick around anyway. In short, it's a good community test too.</li><li>Go the extra mile: If you create a new interface, helper function or whatever try to roll it out everywhere. Even in code you can't run yourself (like drivers for other hardware or similar things), or when you're unsure about how to convert a given piece of code to the new way of doing things. If you have no idea what other piece could benefit from your work, ask around - that's why you started out with talking on IRC after all. The benefit is that by touching lots of other codes you automatically also gain lots more reviewers who might be interesting in your work and help push it forward.</li><li>When submitting your work, or resubmitting revised versions, make sure that everyone who showed interest or might be interested stays informed. There's various support in tooling for this, but with git and mailing-list patch submissions I just add everyone who ever commented on a patch, or who's reviewer or maintainer for an area with a Cc: entry to the patch itself. That way I never forget to add them when resubmitting.</li><li>Doing all this you will have learned a lot - apply that knowledge by reviewing patches from people who commented on your work in related areas. That will also fill your review favours kitty and help get your patches landed.</li><li>If the project uses the maintainer model for committing with no  commit rights for regular contributors, don't ask the maintainer for  review, they're generally overloaded. Instead fan out and try to find  the subject expert, like you would do in a project where all regular  contributors have commit rights.</li><li>Most important of all: Don't just sit&amp;wait around scared and hope your patches will magically land. They won't, not because they're bad but simply because people are busy, and your patches are forever lost in the chaos after just a week or two. Hence ping after a few days about the status, but don't ask when the patches will land, but instead what you can do to move them forward. It's a cheap trick, but it helps to elicit useful responses, at least in my experience.</li><li>And equally important: Don't fall into the imposter syndrome gap or end up blaming yourself when things are a bit bumpy at first - it's just plain hard to figure out undocumented rules of projects who run on chaos and personal relationships. But do try to improve the documentation once you've managed all the pitfalls, to make it easier for the next new person. After all, as the most recent new contributor, you're now the residential expert on this topic!</li></ul>And finally your patches have landed, and in the process you've learned to know a few interesting people. And getting to know new folks is in my opinion really what open source and community is all about. Congrats, and all the best for the next step in your journey!<br /><br />And finally for the flip side, there's a great write up from <a href="http://sarah.thesharps.us/2014/09/01/the-gentle-art-of-patch-review/">Sarah Sharp about doing review</a>, which applies especially to reviewing newcomer's patches.
